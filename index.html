			<p>There are a lot of organizations helping the Latinx Community in Bushwick
				 get non-exploitative legal advice, provide them food and health services 
				 but a lot of the time people are not aware of the existence of these organizations. 
				 Therefore, you will be able to find the support you need by looking at the icons to go to the right place.
